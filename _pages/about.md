Hi! I'm a recently submitted PhD student at Northumbria University working in bioinformatics/computational biology. 

At work, I'm interested in building tools and pipelines for structural and functional annotation of proteins, viruses and metadata (check out [my publications](/publications/) and [repositories](/repositories)).

Im currently looking for jobs in tech-bio or biotech companies, with a particular interest in protein engineering. I hope to work on projects that have a positive impact on society and the environment. If you think I could be a good fit for your team, please get [in touch](mailto:matthewcrown@hotmail.co.uk)!

Outside of work, I enjoy running, bouldering, cooking and tinkering with tech, and I'm a big fan of coffee, football and Formula 1.
