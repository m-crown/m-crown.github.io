               important for the development of immunity against various
               non-communicable diseases including asthma, childhood leukaemia
               and other cancers. Social mixing in daycare settings helps with
               exposure to a variety of microbes. However, social isolation and
               a high emphasis on workplace hygiene during the COVID pandemic
               may have affected children's exposure to diverse microbiota. The
               structure of microbial communities and their role in developing
               immunity to various diseases are not well understood. In this
               study, we investigated the structure of microbial communities in
               daycare and home settings during the pandemic. Interestingly,
               microbial diversity was relatively higher in dust samples
               collected from homes, with human-associated taxa being more
               prevalent compared to those from daycare settings. Environmental
               microbes were more abundant in dust samples from daycare
               providers. These results potentially suggest that cleaning
               practices during the pandemic may have influenced the diversity
               and microbial abundance of the daycare samples. Several bacterial
               taxa detected in both the environments are known to induce
               anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory responses, conferring
               protection from various diseases. Therefore, exposure to diverse
               microbial population in early childhood may play an important
               role in developing immunity against various non-communicable and
               infectious diseases.",

               interactions can enhance our understanding of the core concepts
               of evolution and be used to aid docking and protein design. Since
               the last available cognate-ligand domain database was released,
               the PDB has grown significantly and new tools are available for
               measuring similarity and determining contacts. Results We present
               ProCogGraph, a graph database of cognate-ligand domain mappings
               in PDB structures. Building upon the work of the predecessor
               database, PROCOGNATE, we use data-driven approaches to develop
               thresholds and interaction modes. We explore new aspects of
               domain-cognate ligand interactions, including the chemical
               similarity of bound cognate ligands and how domain combinations
               influence cognate ligand binding. Finally, we use the graph to
               add specificity to partial EC IDs, showing that ProCogGraph can
               complete partial annotations systematically through assigned
               cognate ligands. Availability and Implementation The ProCogGraph

  abstract  = "Summary: Microbiome studies increasingly associate geographical
               features like rurality and climate with microbiomes. It is
               essential to correctly integrate rich geographical metadata; and
               inconsistent definitions of rurality, can hinder cross-study
               comparisons. We address this with OMEinfo, a tool for automated
               retrieval of consistent geographical metadata from user-provided
               location data. OMEinfo leverages open data sources such as the
               Global Human Settlement Layer, and Open-Data Inventory for
               Anthropogenic Carbon dioxide. OMEinfo's web-app enables users to
               visualize and investigate the spatial distribution of metadata
               features. OMEinfo promotes reproducibility and consistency in
               microbiome metadata through a standardized metadata retrieval
               approach. To demonstrate utility, OMEinfo is used to replicate
               the results of a previous study linking population density to
               bacterial diversity. As the field explores relationships between
               microbiomes and geographical features, tools like OMEinfo will
               prove vital in developing a robust, accurate, and interconnected
               understanding of these interactions, whilst having applicability
               beyond this field to any studies utilizing location-based
               metadata. Finally, we release the OMEinfo annotation dataset of
               5.3 million OMEinfo annotated samples from the ENA, for use in
               retrospective analyses of sequencing samples, and suggest several
               ways researchers and sequencing read repositories can improve the
               quality of underlying metadata submitted to these public stores.

              inflammation and viral-induced cell death, resulting in tissue
              damage. We identified the host E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM7 as an
              inhibitor of apoptosis and SARS-CoV-2 replication via
              ubiquitination of the viral membrane (M) protein. Trim7 -/- mice

              Mechanistically, TRIM7 ubiquitinates M on K14, which protects
              cells from cell death. Longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 sequence analysis
              from infected patients revealed that mutations on M-K14 appeared
              in circulating variants during the pandemic. The relevance of
              these mutations was tested in a mouse model. A recombinant
              M-K14/K15R virus showed reduced viral replication, consistent with
              the role of K15 in virus assembly, and increased levels of
              apoptosis associated with the loss of ubiquitination on K14. TRIM7

              bacterial assemblages in our residential environment remains

              bacterial microbiome we selected household vacuum dusts, collected
              through a citizen science approach, from homes across two
              bioclimatic regions (UK, Oceanic/Maritime and Greece,

              sample, we targeted the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using Illumina

              communities at family level grouped samples within their distinct
